# Maximilians Magic Box

Create a music system that allows for the crossfading and composing of music.

## Inspiration:
- Mark music with keys to allow for cross fading and transitional pieces of music
- Mark components as atonal for use in any scene
- Draw inspiration from D&D Alignments
- Draw inspiration from D&D Races
- Find a way to specify space size, wet-moist, hot-cool, windy-still, using all elements

## Roadmap
1) Create audio playback of a single piece of music
2) Cross fade between two different pieces of music (scene)
3) Create a scene with components that can be mixed
4) Crossfade between scenes of components
5) Create dynamic effects
